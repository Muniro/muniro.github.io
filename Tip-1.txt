If you have a ng not recognised error, then it is most likely that either Angular isn't installed - obvious, or
Angular hasn't been added to Enviroment variables for those with Windows OS.

If you can't get this error resolved and time of the issue, then one workaround, is to open Node
command prompt, and use that to run the ng commands.

Tip: If you do install Angular client, ensure you use the --g option (global).




Tip 2: When you have copied an Angular project from an online source, it is most likely without
a key folder called node_modules. The reason is the size of this folder tends to be huge so you might find
it most of the times, this file is removed from the project. The easiest way to re-create this folderis to go
to your command line and type npm install --save. This should fixed the missing node_modules based
on your project.json file.
